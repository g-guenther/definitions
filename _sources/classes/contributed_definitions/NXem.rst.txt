**Status**:

  application definition, extends :ref:`NXobject`

**Description**:

  Characterization and session with one sample in an electron microscope.

  **The idea and aim of NXem**:
  Electron microscopes (EM), whether it be a scanning electron microscope (SEM)
  or a transmission electron microscope (TEM), are versatile tools for preparing
  and characterizing samples and specimens. The term specimen is here understood
  as a synonym for a sample. A specimen is a physical portion of material that
  is studied/characterize in the microscope session, eventually in different
  places on the specimen surface.
  These places are named regions of interest (ROIs).

  Fundamentally, an EM is an electron accelerator. Experimentalists use an EM
  in sessions during which they characterize as well as prepare specimens.
  This application definition describes data and metadata about processes and
  characterization tasks applied to one specimen.

  Multiple specimens have to be described with multiple NXentry instances.

  There are research groups who use an EM in a manner where it is exclusively
  operated by a single, instrument-responsible scientists or a team of 
  (staff) scientists. These users perform analyses for other users as a service
  task. Oftentimes, though, and especially for cutting-edge instruments,
  the scientists and their team guide the process while operating the
  microscope. Oftentimes the scientists operate the instrument themselves
  either on-site or remotely and can ask technicians for support.
  In all cases, these people are considered users. Users might have different
  roles though.

  The rational behind a common EM schema rather than separate SEM or TEM 
  schemata are primarily the key similarities of SEM and TEM instruments:
  Both have electro-magnetic lenses. These lens may differ in design, alignment,
  number, and level of corrected-for aberrations. As an obvious difference,
  a TEM is used mainly to measure the transmitted electron beam.
  This demands thinner specimens as in SEM but offers capabilities for probing 
  of additional physical mechanisms of electron-matter interaction.

  Compared to SEMs, TEMs have a different relative arrangement between the
  lenses and the specimen which is most obvious by the different relative
  arrangement of the objective lens versus the specimen.

  Nevertheless, both types of electron microscopes use detector systems which
  measure different types of signals that originate though from the same set of
  radiation/specimen interactions. Consequently, detectors can also be similar.

  Given these physical and technical differences, different instruments have
  been developed. This led to a coexistence of two broad interacting
  communities: SEM and TEM users. From a data science perspective, we
  acknowledge that the more specific a research question is and the narrower
  the addressed user base is which develops or uses schemata for
  research data management with EM, the more understandable it is
  that scientists of either community (or sub-community) ask for
  method-specific schemata.

  Researchers who have a single (main) microscope of some vendor in their lab,
  may argue they need an NXem_vendor_name schema or an NXem_microscope_name or
  an NXem_sem or a NXem_tem schema.
  Scientists exclusively working with one technique or type of signal probed
  (X-rays, electrons) may argue they wish to be pragmatic and store only
  what is immediately relevant for their particular technique and
  research questions. In effect, they may advocate for method-specific
  schemata such as NXem_ebsd, NXem_eels, NXem_edx, or NXem_imaging.

  The development in the past has shown that these activities led to a zoo of
  schemata and implementations of these into many data and file formats.
  There is nothing which prevents the communities to make these schemata
  open and interoperable. Open here means specifically not that all data are
  compliant with/or use the schema and have to end up in the open-source domain.
  There can be embargo periods first of all. Open means that the metadata and 
  associated schemata are documented in a manner that as many details as 
  possible are open in the sense that others can understand what the 
  (meta)data mean conceptually. 
  The `FAIR principles <https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18>`_ guide all 
  decisions how data and metadata should be stored.

  EM instruments, software, and research are moving targets. Consequently,
  there is a key challenge and inconvenience with having many different 
  schemata with associated representations of data and metadata in EM:
  Each combination of schemata or an interoperable-made handshake between two
  file formats or software packages has to be maintained by software developers.
  This counts especially when data should be processed interoperably
  between software packages.

  This brings two problems: Many software tools and parsers for the handshaking
  between tools to maintain. This can result in usage of different terminology.
  Which in turn results in representations and connections made between 
  different data representations and workflows that are not machine-actionable.
  `There are community efforts to harmonize the terminology. <https://gitlab.hzdr.de/em_glossary/em_glossary>`_

  A common vocabulary can serve interoperability as developers of schemata
  and scientists can take for instance then these terms as closely as possible.
  Ideally, they specialize the application definition only for the few very
  specific additional quantities of their instruments and techniques. This is
  better than reimplementing the wheel for descriptions of EM instruments.
  This route of more standardization can support the EM community in that it
  removes the necessity for having to maintain a very large number of schemata.

  Aiming for more standardization, i.e. a lower number of schemata rather than
  a single standard for electron microscopy is a compromise that can serve
  academia as it enables the EM community to focus their software development
  efforts on those schemata, on fixing and discussing them, and on harmonize
  their common vocabulary. These activities can be specifically relevant also
  for vendors of EM hard- and software as it improves the longevity of certain
  schema and thus can help to incentivize vendors to support the community with
  implementing support for such schemata into their proprietary applications.

  In effect, everybody can gain from this as it will likely reduce the cases
  in which scientists have to fix bugs in making their own tools compliant and
  interoperable with tools of their colleagues and the wider community.

  The here proposed NXem application definition offers modular components
  (EM-research specific base classes) for using NeXus to define schemata for
  electron microscopy research. Working towards a common vocabulary is a
  community activity that profits from everybody reflecting in detail whether
  certain terms they have used are not eventually conceptually similar if not
  the same as what this application definition and its base classes provide.

  We are happy for receiving your feedback.

  It is noteworthy to understand that (not only for) NeXus, schema differ
  already if at least one field is required in one version of the schema,
  but it is set optional in another version. If group(s), field(s), or
  attributes are removed or added, or even a docstring is changed, schemata can
  become inconsistent. An application definition here serves as a contract
  between a data provider and a data consumer. These two can be software tools
  (like the vendor software to drive the instrument or a scientific software
  for doing artificial intelligence with EM data).
  Such changes of a schema lead to new versions.

  Tools like NeXus do not avoid or protect against inconsistencies; however
  NeXus offers a mechanism and toolset, through which schemata can be
  documented and defined. In effect, having an openly documented
  (at a case-specific level of technical detail) schema is a necessary but alone
  not a sufficient step to take EM research on a route of machine-actionable 
  and interoperable FAIR data.
  A common vocabulary and a machine-actionable knowledge representation/engine
  is also required. Essentially when the docstrings are no longer needed
  but can be replaced by a connection to an automated tool which understands
  what a specific field represents conceptually, EM data have become more
  generally interoperable EM data.

  This application definition takes a key step into this direction.
  It offers a controlled vocabulary and relation between concepts and data
  relevant for research with electron microscopes. To be most efficient and
  offering reusability, the application definition should be understood as a
  template that one should ideally use as is. This application definition
  is called NXem. It can be considered a base for more specialized definitions
  (ideally prefixed with NXem) *method*.

  **The use of NXem should be as follows:**
  Offspring application definitions should not remove groups but make
  them optional or, even better, propose changes in the application definition.

  A particular challenge with electron microscopes as physical instruments are
  their dynamics. To make EM data understandable, repeatable, and eventually
  corresponding experiments reproducible in general requires a documentation
  of the spatio-temporal dynamics of the instrument in its environment.
  For most commercial systems there is a specific accessibility beyond which
  detailed settings like lens excitations and low-level hardware settings
  may not be retrievable.

  EM experiments by design illuminate the specimen with electrons as a
  consequence of which the specimen changes if not may get destroyed.
  As such, repeatability of numerical processing and clear descriptions of
  procedures and system setups should be addressed first.

  If especially a certain simulation package needs a detailed view of the
  geometry of the lens system and its excitations during the course of the
  experiment, it is difficult to fully abstract the technical details of the
  hardware into a set of names for fields and groups that make for a compromise
  between clarity and being vendor-agnostic. Settings of apertures are an 
  example where aperture modes are aliases behind which there is a set of
  settings. These settings are difficult to retrieve, often undocumented in
  detail. This serves users and makes EM experiments easier understandable and
  conveniently executable for a broader user base. The opportunities for 
  application definitions to offer an abstraction layer are limited.

  Instead, currently it is for the docstring to specify what is conceptually
  eventually behind such aliases. The design rule we followed while drafting 
  the application definition and base classes is that there are numerous 
  (technical) details about an EM which may warrant a very detailed technical
  disentangling of settings and reflection of numerous settings as deeply
  nested groups, fields and attributes. An application definition can offer a
  place to hold these nested representations; however at the cost of generality.

  Which specific details matter for answering scientific research questions is
  a difficult question to answer by a single team of scientists, especially
  if the application definition is to speak for a number of vendors. What makes
  it especially challenging if the application definition is expected to hold
  all data that might be of relevance for future questions.

  We are skeptical if there is one representation that can fulfill all these
  aims, while remaining at the same time approachable and executable by a large
  number of scientists in a community. With this application definition we 
  would like to motivate the community to work towards such aim. While doing
  so we found that existent terminology can be encoded into a more controlled
  vocabulary.

  We have concluded that despite all these details of current EM research with
  SEM, TEM, and focused-ion beam instruments, there a clearly identifiable
  common components and generalizable settings of EM research use cases.

  **This application definition has the following components at the top-level:**

  * Generic experimental details (timestamp, identifiers, name);  
    conceptually these are session details. A session at a microscope may  
    involve the characterization of multiple specimens. For each specimen  
    an instance of an (NXentry) is created. Details of the instrument have to  
    be stored at least in an entry. Other entries should refer to these  
    metadata via links to reduce redundancies.  
  * Each signal, such as a spectrum or image taken at the microscope, should  
    have an associated time stamp and report of the specific settings at that  
    point in time when the image was taken. The reason is that EMs can be  
    highly dynamic, be used to illuminate the specimen differently  
    or show drift during signal acquisition, to name but a few effects.  
    What constitutes a single EM experiment/measurement? This can be the  
    collecting of a single diffraction pattern with a scanning TEM (STEM),  
    taking of a secondary electron image for fracture analysis, taking a set  
    of EBSD line scan and surface mappings in an SEM, or ion-beam-milling of a  
    specimen in preparation for an atom probe experiment.  
  * NXmonitor;
    instances to keep track of time-dependent quantities  
    pertaining to specific components of the instrument. Alternatively  
    NXevent_data_em instances can be used to store timestamp states of the  
    components, which is relevant to document the exact settings when images  
    and spectra were taken.  
  * NXinstrument;
    conceptually this is a container to store arbitrary level of detail of the  
    technical components of the microscope as a device and the lab in which  
    it is operated.  
  * NXuser;
    conceptually, this is a set with at least one NXuser instance which details  
    who operated or performed the measurement. Additional NXusers can be  
    referred to in an NXevent_data_em instance to store  
    individualized details who executed an event.  
  * NXevent_data_em instances as an NXevent_data_em_set;  
    each NXevent_data_em instance is a container to group specific details  
    about the state of the microscope when a measurement was taken and  
    relevant data and eventual processing steps were taken (on-the-fly).  
  * NXdata; a the top-level, conceptually, this is a place for documenting  
    available default plottable data. A default plottable can be useful for  
    research data management systems to show a visual representation of some  
    aspect of the content of the EM session.  
    It is clear that what constitutes a useful default plot is a matter of  
    interpretation, somewhat of personal taste, and community standards.

  In effect, default plottables are case- and method-specific.
  Usually a session at a microscope is used to collect multiple signals and
  images. Examples for possible default plottables could be an arbitrarily
  taken: secondary, back-scattered, electron image, diffraction pattern,
  EELS spectra, composition, or orientation mappings to name but a few.

  **There are a few design choices to consider with sub-ordinate groups:**

  * Above images, spectra, and mappings should be stored as NXdata instances,  
    ideally formatted in such a way that they can be displayed with  
    visualization software that can be specific for the file format in which  
    the data are stored. NeXus specifies only the data model, i.e. the terms  
    and their relations. These descriptions can be implemented and stored in  
    JSON, HDF5, XML, or HSDS, file storage, or even other formats, although  
    HDF5 is the most commonly used.
  * Consumable results of EM characterization tasks are usually a sub-set of  
    data artifacts, as there is not an infinite amount of possible  
    electron/ion beam-specimen interactions.  
  * Images of electron counts detected in specific operation modes (bright  
    field, dark field in TEM, secondary/back-scattered, Kikuchi in SEM)  
  * Spectra (X-ray quanta or auger electron counts)  
  * These data are in virtually all cases a result of some numerical
    processing. It makes sense to name them with a controlled vocabulary,  
    e.g. SE (secondary electron), BSE (back-scattered electron), Kikuchi,  
    X-ray, Auger, Cathodolum(inescence) etc.

  A key question often asked with EM experiments is how the actual (meta)data
  should be stored (in memory or on disk). To this end the schema, here makes no
  specific assumptions, not even that all the fields/group of a schema instance
  have to be stored into a single file. Instead, the schema specifies the
  relations between metadata, constraints on how they should be formatted, what
  they conceptually represent and which terms (controlled vocabulary) is
  practical to store with the data.

  In effect, the application definition is a graph which describes how
  (meta)data are related to one another.

**Structure**:

  .. _/NXem/ENTRY-group:

  **ENTRY**: (required) :ref:`NXentry`


    .. _/NXem/ENTRY@version-attribute:

    .. index:: version (group attribute)

    **@version**: (required) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

      An at least as strong as SHA256 hashvalue of the file
      that specifies the application definition.

    .. _/NXem/ENTRY/definition-field:

    .. index:: definition (field)

    **definition**: (required) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

      NeXus NXDL schema to which this file conforms.

      Obligatory value: ``NXem``

    .. _/NXem/ENTRY/experiment_identifier-field:

    .. index:: experiment_identifier (field)

    **experiment_identifier**: (required) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

      Ideally, a (globally) unique persistent identifier
      for referring to this experiment.

      The identifier is usually defined/issued by the facility, laboratory,
      or the principle investigator.
      The identifier enables to link experiments to e.g. proposals.

    .. _/NXem/ENTRY/experiment_description-field:

    .. index:: experiment_description (field)

    **experiment_description**: (optional) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

      Free-text description about the experiment.

      Users are strongly advised to detail the sample history in the respective 
      field and fill rather as completely as possible the fields of this 
      application definition rather than write details about the experiment
      into this free-text description field.

    .. _/NXem/ENTRY/start_time-field:

    .. index:: start_time (field)

    **start_time**: (required) :ref:`NX_DATE_TIME <NX_DATE_TIME>`

      ISO 8601 time code with local time zone offset to UTC information included
      when the microscope session started. If the application demands that time
      codes in this section of the application definition should only be used
      for specifying when the experiment was performed - and the exact
      duration is not relevant - this start time field should be used.

      Often though it is useful to specify a time interval with specifying
      both start_time and end_time to allow for more detailed bookkeeping and
      interpretation of the experiment. The user should be aware that even
      with having both time instances specified, it may not be possible
      to infer how long the experiment took or for how long data were acquired.

      More detailed timing data over the course of the experiment have
      to be collected to compute this. These computations can take
      advantage of individual time stamps in NXevent_em instances to
      provide additional pieces of information.

    .. _/NXem/ENTRY/end_time-field:

    .. index:: end_time (field)

    **end_time**: (required) :ref:`NX_DATE_TIME <NX_DATE_TIME>`

      ISO 8601 time code with local time zone offset to UTC included when
      the microscope session ended.

    .. _/NXem/ENTRY/program-field:

    .. index:: program (field)

    **program**: (required) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

      Commercial or otherwise given name to the program which was used to
      create the file.

      Electron microscopy experiments are usually controlled/performed via
      commercial integrated acquisition and instrument control software.
      In many cases, an EM dataset is useful only if it gets post-processed
      already during the acquisition, i.e. while the scientist is sitting
      at the microscope.
      Many of these processes are automated, while some demand GUI
      interactions with the control software. Examples include collecting
      of diffraction pattern and on-the-fly indexing of these.

      It is possible that different types of programs might be used to 
      perform these processing steps whether on-the-fly or not. If this is
      the case the processing should be structured with individual NXprocess
      instances. If the program and/or version used for processing referred
      to in an NXprocess group is different to the program and version
      mentioned in this field, the NXprocess needs
      to hold an own program and version.

      .. _/NXem/ENTRY/program@version-attribute:

      .. index:: version (field attribute)

      **@version**: (required) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

        Program version plus build number, commit hash, or description of
        an ever persistent resource where the source code of the program
        and build instructions can be found so that the program can be

        recreatable yielding the same results.

    .. _/NXem/ENTRY/experiment_documentation-group:

    **experiment_documentation**: (optional) :ref:`NXnote`

      Binary container for a file or a compressed collection of files which
      can be used to add further descriptions and details to the experiment.
      The container can hold a compressed archive.

    .. _/NXem/ENTRY/thumbnail-group:

    **thumbnail**: (optional) :ref:`NXnote`

      A small image that is representative of the entry; this can be an
      image taken from the dataset like a thumbnail of a spectrum.
      A 640 x 480 pixel jpeg image is recommended. 
      Adding a scale bar to that image is recommended but not required
      as the main purpose of the thumbnail is to provide e.g. thumbnail
      images for displaying them in data repositories.

      .. _/NXem/ENTRY/thumbnail@type-attribute:

      .. index:: type (group attribute)

      **@type**: (required) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

        Postal address of the affiliation.

      .. _/NXem/ENTRY/operator/email-field:

      .. index:: email (field)

      **email**: (required) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

        Email address of the user at the point in time when the experiment was
        performed. Writing the most permanently used email is recommended.

        Which role does the user have in the place and at the point 
        in time when the experiment was performed? Technician operating
        the microscope. Student, postdoc, principle investigator, guest
        are common examples.

      .. _/NXem/ENTRY/operator/social_media_name-field:

      .. index:: social_media_name (field)

      **social_media_name**: (optional) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

        Account name that is associated with the user in social media platforms.

      .. _/NXem/ENTRY/operator/social_media_platform-field:

      .. index:: social_media_platform (field)

      **social_media_platform**: (optional) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

        Name of the social media platform where the account under social_media_name is
        registered.

    .. _/NXem/ENTRY/SAMPLE-group:

      A description of the material characterized in the experiment.
      Sample and specimen are threaded as de facto synonyms.

      .. _/NXem/ENTRY/SAMPLE/method-field:

      .. index:: method (field)

      **method**: (required) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

        A qualifier whether the sample is a real one or a virtual one (in a computer
        simulation)

        Any of these values: ``experimental`` | ``simulation``

      .. _/NXem/ENTRY/SAMPLE/name-field:

      .. index:: name (field)

      **name**: (required) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

        The name distinguishes the specimen from all others and especially
        the predecessor/origin from where the specimen was cut.

        This field must not be used for an alias of the sample.
        Instead, use short_title.

        In cases where multiple specimens have been loaded into the microscope
        the name has to identify the specific one, whose results are stored
        by this NXentry, because a single NXentry should be used only for
        the characterization of a single specimen.

        Details about the specimen preparation should be stored in the
        sample history.

      .. _/NXem/ENTRY/SAMPLE/sample_history-field:

      .. index:: sample_history (field)

      **sample_history**: (required) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

        Ideally, a reference to a (globally) unique persistent identifier, representing a data 
        artifact which documents ideally as many details of the material, its microstructure,
        and its thermo-chemo-mechanical processing/preparation history as possible.

        The sample_history is the record what happened before the specimen was placed into the
        microscope at the beginning of the session.

        In the case that such a detailed history of the sample/specimen is not available, use this field as
        a free-text description to specify a sub-set of the entire sample history, i.e. what you would consider
        are the key steps and relevant information about the specimen, its material, microstructure, 
        thermo-chemo-mechanical processing state, and the details of the preparation.

        Specific details about eventual physically-connected material like embedding resin should be
        documented ideally also in the sample_history. If all fails, the description field
        can be used but it is strongly discouraged because it leads to eventually non-machine-actionable
        data.

      .. _/NXem/ENTRY/SAMPLE/preparation_date-field:

      .. index:: preparation_date (field)

      **preparation_date**: (required) :ref:`NX_DATE_TIME <NX_DATE_TIME>`

        ISO 8601 time code with local time zone offset to UTC information when the specimen was prepared.

        Ideally report the end of the preparation, i.e. the last known time the measured specimen surface
        was actively prepared. Usually this should be a part of the sample history, i.e. the sample
        is imagined handed over for the analysis. At the point it enters the microscope the session starts.

        Knowing when the specimen was exposed to e.g. specific atmosphere is especially required for
        environmentally sensitive material such as hydrogen charged specimens or experiments
        including tracers with a short half time. Further time stamps prior to preparation_date should
        better be placed in resources which describe the sample_history.

      .. _/NXem/ENTRY/SAMPLE/short_title-field:

      .. index:: short_title (field)

      **short_title**: (optional) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

        Possibility to give an abbreviation or alias of the specimen name field.

      .. _/NXem/ENTRY/SAMPLE/atom_types-field:

      .. index:: atom_types (field)

      **atom_types**: (required) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

        Use Hill's system for listing elements of the periodic table which are inside or attached
        to the surface of the specimen and thus relevant from a scientific point of view.

        The purpose of the field is to offer materials database systems an opportunity to parse
        the relevant elements without having to interpret these from the sample history.

      .. _/NXem/ENTRY/SAMPLE/thickness-field:

      .. index:: thickness (field)

      **thickness**: (required) :ref:`NX_FLOAT <NX_FLOAT>` {units=\ :ref:`NX_LENGTH <NX_LENGTH>`}

        (Measured) sample thickness. The information is recorded to qualify
        if the beam used was likely able to shine through the specimen.

      .. _/NXem/ENTRY/SAMPLE/description-field:

      .. index:: description (field)

      **description**: (optional) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

        Discouraged free-text field in case properly designed records for the
        sample_history are not available.

    .. _/NXem/ENTRY/DATA-group:

    **DATA**: (required) :ref:`NXdata`

      Hard link to a location in the hierarchy of the NeXus file
      where the data for default plotting are stored.

    .. _/NXem/ENTRY/COORDINATE_SYSTEM_SET-group:

    **COORDINATE_SYSTEM_SET**: (required) :ref:`NXcoordinate_system_set`


    .. _/NXem/ENTRY/MONITOR-group:

    **MONITOR**: (optional) :ref:`NXmonitor`


    .. _/NXem/ENTRY/em_lab-group:

    **em_lab**: (required) :ref:`NXinstrument`

      Metadata and numerical data of the microscope and the lab in which it stands.

      The em_lab section contains a description of the instrument and its components.
      The component descriptions in this section differ from those inside individual
      NXevent_em sections. These event instances take the role of time snapshot.
      For an NXevent_em instance users should store only those settings for a 
      component which are relevant to understand the current state of the component.
      Here, current means at the point in time, i.e. the time interval, 
      which the event represents.

      For example it is not relevant to store in each event's electron_gun group
      again the details of the gun type and manufacturer but only the high-voltage
      if for that event the high-voltage was different. If for all events
      the high-voltage was the same it is not even necessary to include an electron_gun
      section in the event.

      Individual sections of specific type should have the following names:

      * NXaperture: the name should match with the name of the lens  
      * NXlens_em: condenser_lens, objective_lens are commonly used names  
      * NXcorrector_cs: device for correcting spherical aberrations  
      * NXstage_lab: a collection of component for holding the specimen and  
        eventual additional component for applying external stimuli on the sample  
      * NXdetector: several possible names like secondary_electron,  
        backscattered_electron, direct_electron, ebsd, edx, wds, auger,  
        cathodoluminescence, camera, ronchigram

      .. _/NXem/ENTRY/em_lab/instrument_name-field:

      .. index:: instrument_name (field)

      **instrument_name**: (required) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

        Given name of the microscope at the hosting institution. This is an alias.
        Examples could be NionHermes, Titan, JEOL, Gemini, etc.

      .. _/NXem/ENTRY/em_lab/location-field:

      .. index:: location (field)

      **location**: (optional) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

        Location of the lab or place where the instrument is installed.
        Using GEOREF is preferred.

      **OPTICAL_SYSTEM_EM**: (optional) :ref:`NXoptical_system_em`


      .. _/NXem/ENTRY/em_lab/DETECTOR-group:

      **DETECTOR**: (required) :ref:`NXdetector`

        Description of the type of the detector.

        Electron microscopes have typically multiple detectors.
        Different technologies are in use like CCD, scintillator, 
        direct electron, CMOS, or image plate to name but a few.

        .. _/NXem/ENTRY/em_lab/DETECTOR/description-field:

        .. index:: description (field)

        **description**: (optional) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

          Free text option to write further details about the detector.

        .. _/NXem/ENTRY/em_lab/DETECTOR/MANUFACTURER-group:

        **MANUFACTURER**: (required) :ref:`NXmanufacturer`


      .. _/NXem/ENTRY/em_lab/PUMP-group:

      **PUMP**: (optional) :ref:`NXpump`


    .. _/NXem/ENTRY/measurement-group:

    **measurement**: (optional) :ref:`NXevent_data_em_set`

      A container to structure a set of NXevent_em instances.

      An event is a time point/interval during which the microscope
      was configured in a specific way and the microscope was used
      to take a measurement.

      Each NXevent_em holds an acquisition task with the microscope.
      For instance the capturing of a secondary electron, backscattered
      electron, diffraction image, or spectrum.

      An NXevent_em_data instance holds specific details about how raw data 
      from a detector were processed into consumable data like images, spectra,
      etc. These on-the-fly data processing tasks are usually performed
      by the control software, eventually realized with custom scripts.

      Furthermore, NXevent_em_state instances can document specific values
      and settings of the microscope during the snapshot/event.

      .. _/NXem/ENTRY/measurement/EVENT_DATA_EM-group:

      **EVENT_DATA_EM**: (required) :ref:`NXevent_data_em`

        A container holding a specific result of the measurement and
        eventually metadata how that result was obtained numerically.

        NXevent_em instances can hold several specific
        NXimage_em or NXspectrum_em instances taken and considered as
        one event, i.e. a point in time when the microscope had the
        settings specified either in NXinstrument or in this NXevent_data_em
        instance.

        The application definition is designed without an explicit need
        an NXevent_data_em instance that contains an NXimage_em or 
        NXspectra_em instance. An NXevent_data_em can be used to document a
        specific state of the microscope at a time without having it placed
        into the NXinstrument group.

        In other words the NXinstrument group details primarily the more
        static settings and components of the microscope as they are found
        by the operator during the session. The NXevent_data_em samples
        the dynamics.

        It is not necessary to store data in NXebeam, NXibeam instances
        of NXevent_data_em but in this case it is assumed that the settings
        were constant over the entire course of microscope session
        and thus all relevant metadata inside the NXinstrument groups
        are sufficient to understand the session.

          The detector or set of detectors that was used to collect this signal.
          The name of the detector has to match one of the names of available
          NXdetector instances e.g. if the instrument has an ebsd_camera
          the detector for an NXimage_em_kikuchi should be the NXdetector
          instance called ebsd_camera.
